<h1>How We Started</h1>
<p>saving lives started in 2018 when we found a gap in the healthcare sector of those living in communities out of town</p>

<h1>Our Mision</h1>
<p>realizing that alot of communities in the rural areas lack accsess to good health care and drugs, we decided to come together and provide a platform to connect these communities to medical personels and health care providers to be able to reach out to those in need of their services, without the ability to pay for them.</p>

<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>To give those in underserved communities access to the best healthcare services and drugs for free</p>
